    <h3>Poem</h3>
    <p>Some say the world will end in fire,<br>
Some say in ice.<br>
From what I’ve tasted of desire<br>
I hold with those who favor fire.<br>
But if it had to perish twice,<br>
I think I know enough of hate<br>
To say that for destruction ice<br>
Is also great<br>
And would suffice.</p>
