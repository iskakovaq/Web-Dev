    This is a big paragraph of text about Udacity. Cool. Cool. And here is an
    image!
    <img
            src="http://udacity.github.io/fend/images/udacity.png"
            alt="Udacity Logo"
    />
    Here's another question for you: how is the text reacting to the image? Is
    the image on its own line or is it showing up in the same last as the rest
    of the text?
